**Church Roles**

This page acts as a rudimentary definition structure of roles found within the Palmarian Church. Initially, I'd recognized the roles to be too similar to the Roman Catholic church to necessitate a new document, however, I find it to be relevant to have some definitions.

This page is a work in progress.

**Priests** fill a similar role to that within other orders of traditional Christianity -- however, sacraments are more limited due to the extreme centralization of power.

**Bishops and Deacons** appear to fill a similar role to the priests.

**Cardinals** are considered more set-apart -- instead of simply being bishops with the additional responsibility/papal candidacy, Cardinals within the Palmarian Church seemingly act as primary apologists, as resources gathered indicate that the largest apologist prescence on social media sites like TikTok are actually high-ranking officials, like cardinals.

**The Pope** of the Palmarian church is actually considered both theologically and ontologically to be an anti-pope. In addition to this status of undermining a singular papal office (and the historical significance of this office within the Palmarian church), there is no clear succession plan, and papal authority is passed down through a monarch line, rather than a democratic vote.

**Carmelite Nuns** are members of a religious order within the Palmarian church. These nuns focus on prayer, contemplation, and living a traditional cloistered life. However, the intense requirements of women dress and behavior mandated by the church echoes into the order much stronger than the non-sectarian counterparts.
