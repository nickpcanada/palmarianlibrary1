**This is all under construction!**

**THIS IS *STILL* UNDER CONSTRUCTION!**

In an effort to make things more interactive...

1. Introduce Project: One last time, and find its four corners
2. Express dismay at temporal contraints
3. Go through this sub-list
  
  a. What materials am I providing? Aim at larger io or carrd site, hyperlink hub with explanatory lexias
  
  b. How have I prepared these? So far, I aim to provide some more clear instructions on this readme and it be utilized as a launching pad for independent research -- or just curiosity-satiating. 
  
  c. When I look back, where di I end up? Simultanously very far away -- and yet, somewhere I want to be. Scope, scope, scope.
  
  d. What have I learned that I could apply to future projects? Tons. Utilize summers.


  **Lifted from 'projectdefinitions'**
 
**Boundaries for DSAM 1** Figuring out the four corners and giving myself a more springy trampoline to launch into DSAM 2. 

**Goals for DSAM 2** Making this into the site of my dreams. Or, at least, fleshing out the entire catalog of content on the main channel and finding more efficient ways to demonstrate this data, visually. Don't get bullied too hard.

**Timescale for entire project** Ideally, end of summer.


I know the optics of this GitHub are really rough, and I swear that I have been working on this for a while and have deleted much more text than I've written (yikes, I know); in fact, throughout my video presentations and discussion posts over the semester, you likely have *seen* the non-presented iterations of the project, or even just snippets as I click around my desktop while talking/recording.

Anyway, this is what I have for iteration 3 that is even *slightly* presentable. Granted, I'd tried several different visualizers recently, including the tools utilized in our classes, but the only one that seems to provide a web that I sort-of like is Kumu.io -- so I've imported one month of published content from the Holy Palmarian Church into it and just tried to map it out.

Yes, it is ugly. Yes, it is obtuse. Yes, it is concise. However, I'd hope to incorporate this into a larger website project (nothing crazy, maybe just a [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) site) with lexias and hyperlinks that would expand on the most relevant topics.

Okay, so, **enough preamble! Time for some information!**
*The way to view this project is to examine the image of the information web after going through definitions and then cross-checking the web with the ['kumuexpanded.md'](kumuexpanded.md) file.* (So far, there is only one expansion -- as the library is further tracked [and I move things over from the previous sites I was using but gave up on], it will get larger and more full).

So YES!
1. Engage with the ['projectdefinition.md'](projectdefinition.md)
2. Engage with ['churchdefinitions.md'](churchdefinitions.md) AND ANY images present.
3. Use the ['kumuexpanded.md'](kumuexpanded.md) file as a temporary broken-hyperlinked page by which you can access lexias that fill in the MOST revelatory information/doctrine/explanations from the info web.
4. Keep any and all other md files in the back of your mind for DSAM 2.
